# Stable Coin Collateral with WETH & WBTC ðŸ’°

A decentralized protocol for minting stablecoins using WETH and WBTC as collateral. This project enables users to deposit supported assets, mint stablecoins, and interact with advanced functionality such as liquidation and collateral management.

<h3>Features:</h3>

- **Collateralized Stablecoin Minting**: Deposit WETH or WBTC as collateral to mint stablecoins.
- **Liquidation Mechanism**: Ensures protocol stability through automated liquidation of under-collateralized positions.
- **Collateral Management**: Support for multiple operations, including depositing, withdrawing, and managing collateral positions.
- **Fully Decentralized**: Built entirely in Solidity to ensure transparency and security.
- **Invariant Fuzz Testing**: Ensures protocol stability under edge cases and adversarial conditions using Foundry's invariant testing framework.
- **Robust Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage using Foundry for contract reliability and security.

This project is ideal for those looking to understand stablecoin mechanisms, Solidity development, and decentralized financial protocols. It includes robust testing to ensure that the protocol remains secure and reliable under a wide range of scenarios.
